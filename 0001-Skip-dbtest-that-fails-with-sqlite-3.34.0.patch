Subject: [PATCH] Skip dbtest that fails with sqlite 3.34.0

Root cause is unknown, but one of the dbtests began to fail after we
updated sqlite to 3.34.0. Skip it for now.

[2021-05-14]: An upstream bug report was filed on 2021-02-02 that contains more
              detail on the underlying problem:
